# [fit] Borders.none()
# [fit] Building a Borderless Global Flutter Community

--- 

# Borders.none()

One of the most amazing things about Flutter is how it has captured the imagination of developers all over the world. No matter what language or level of programming experience, tens of thousands of people have found a home. And they are eager to share and learn. There are now hundreds of local groups across the globe devoted to Flutter. This very hackathon is proof of that, with 70 hubs from 35 countries participating. 

---

# Borders.none()

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to imagine how to strengthen the global Flutter community. How can we better communicate with one another? How can we help each other learn? How can we connect people to opportunities?

---

# Borders.none()

Few ideas:

- Social network
- Chat/Slack alternative
- Job finder
- Mentor matcher

---

# Borders.none()

Few ideas:

- Text translation
- Stack Overflow search
- Code search

---

# [fit] Happy coding!
